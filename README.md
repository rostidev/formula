## Formula Demonstration

3D to 2D projection demo with rotating wireframe models.

This is a ported to C with SDL3 version of https://github.com/tsoding/formula originally implemented as a web app
and explained in the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjWkNZ0SXfo live coding session.

This is a little bit extended version, that shows one penguin and several cubes rotating together.

### Build

Make sure you have GCC, GNU Make and SDL3 library for development installed.

Then run:

```
make
./formula
```

Run `make clean` to remove all build artifacts.
